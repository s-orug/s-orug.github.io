            <h2>What?</h2>
            <p>Here are some key areas I've been working on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="reads.html">Reads</a> - A peek into what I'm reading and my thoughts on each of them.</li>
                <li><a href="skills.html">Skills</a> - Projects I'm tackling and skills I'm developing along the way.
                </li>
                <li><a href="life.html">Life</a> - My goals, inspirations, and what keeps me moving forward.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p> Perfection is an illusion, and I haven't encountered anyone who has mastered every aspect of life. It
                often becomes elusive because many of us give up on our goals at the first sign of difficulty. A study
                by Columbia University revealed that fewer than 10% of Americans manage to achieve their New Year's
                resolutions."</p>

            <p> I'm embarking on a journey with the sole purpose of sticking to a plan and maintaining consistency in
                areas
                that have been proven to improve my life. This includes getting full night's sleep, working out, eating
                healthy, and work towards learning new skills
                <b>EVERY SINGLE DAY</b>.
                These are goals that have been proved to help peoples' lives. This platform will serve as a
                space where I document my progress, with a slither of hope that sharing my journey can inspire others to
                improve their own lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't expect this to be a easy journey, but I believe in the end it will be very rewarding.
                One my favorite quotes by Lex Fridman is "Without difficulty there is no triumph in success."
                The tumultuous parts of a journey are often the ones we remember and cherish the most. If we take those
                moments as learning opportunities and truly believe that nothing is impossible, the impact one can have
                dwarfs the impact of those who doubt.
